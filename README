Faculty evaluation system is based on schools/colleges/teaching institute's evaluation system which is generally paper based and now to save trees I have developed small web-based intranet system. 

Features
========

1) php/mysql open source and generalized 
2) Ajax is used for filtration and to get faster response
3) Graph, Reports and Excel file are generated of individual faculty with remarks (if student has entered remark)

Note
====
Commercial patch is available for "Student Login" with student id generator.

Details of feedback system
==========================

Structure of the institute 

Batch -> Branch -> Semester -> Division -> Faculty -> Subject

So You can Add/Edit/Delete to Batch, Branch, Semester, Division, Faculty & Subject

Example:

	Batch: August '08
	Branch: Network and Telecommunication
	Faculty: 1) Rajesh Mishra
		   2) Mohan Das

	Subject: 1) Routing Protocol taught by Rajesh Mishra in Semester (I) & Division (Class B)
		   2) Computer Networks taught by Mohan Das in Semester (I) & Division (Class B)

Set parameter: Batch -> Branch -> Semester -> Division to get the result(graph/excel) from feedback.php page. 

Faculty evaluation Parameter: Feedback Ques

You can change evaluation parameter by editing it.

Students will rate the Subject faculty within the range of 0 - 9

Graph will be generated according to the number of student and their rating.

You can also take backup of your database.
