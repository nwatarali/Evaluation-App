I'm releasing this under the GPL...  enjoy.

Note that some of the code used herein was scarfed from other sites, and I didn't find a
license with the code.  I'm assuming it's GPL as well, but if it's not - let me know so I 
can rewrite things to make it all kosher...

Find a copy of the GPL if you really want to read that blather, otherwise just abide by it
OK?  Thanks for your support
